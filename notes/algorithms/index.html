<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-algorithm">What is Algorithm?</h2>
<p>An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that solves a well-defined computational problem.
It takes some input and produces some output correctly in a finite amount of time (it halts).</p>
<p>An instance of a problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.</p>
<h2 id="model-of-computation">Model of computation</h2>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>
<h2 id="reduction">Reduction</h2>
<p>Reduction is a technique used in designing algorithms that involves writing an algorithm for one problem, X, using an algorithm for another problem, Y, as a subroutine. The resulting algorithm for X is correct regardless of how the algorithm for Y works, and the inner workings of the algorithm for Y are not relevant to the algorithm for X. This technique allows for the creation of more efficient algorithms by replacing subroutines with more efficient versions.</p>
<h2 id="recursion">Recursion</h2>
<p>Recursion is a particularly powerful kind of reduction, which can be described
Recursion is a method of solving a problem by reducing it to one or more simpler instances of the same problem</p>
