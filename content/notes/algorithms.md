## What is Algorithm?

An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that solves a well-defined computational problem.
It takes some input and produces some output correctly in a finite amount of time (it halts).

An instance of a problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

## Model of computation

## Sorting

## Reduction
Reduction is a technique used in designing algorithms that involves writing an algorithm for one problem, X, using an algorithm for another problem, Y, as a subroutine. The resulting algorithm for X is correct regardless of how the algorithm for Y works, and the inner workings of the algorithm for Y are not relevant to the algorithm for X. This technique allows for the creation of more efficient algorithms by replacing subroutines with more efficient versions.

## Recursion
Recursion is a particularly powerful kind of reduction, which can be described
Recursion is a method of solving a problem by reducing it to one or more simpler instances of the same problem
